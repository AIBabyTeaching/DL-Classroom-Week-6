    "### The Origins of Self-Organizing Maps\n",
    "Self-Organizing Maps, also known as Kohonen maps, were developed by Teuvo Kohonen in the early 1980s. They are inspired by the structure and organization of the human brain's visual cortex.\n",
    "The development of SOMs marked a significant milestone in the field of artificial neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOMs were developed to address the limitations of traditional neural networks, particularly in handling high-dimensional data, capturing topological relationships, and enabling unsupervised learning, data visualization, and clustering.\n",

    "### What is a Self-Organizing Map (SOM)?\n",
    "A Self-Organizing Map is a type of artificial neural network used for unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction. It is known for its ability to preserve the topological relationships between input data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Topological relationships: It describes qualitative properties that characterize the relative position of spatial objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Characteristics of SOMs:\n",
    "- Topological ordering: SOMs preserve the topological properties of the input data.\n",
    "- Competitive learning: Neurons compete to represent input patterns.\n",
    "- Neighborhood function: Neurons within a certain neighborhood adapt to similar input patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOMs are often used for tasks such as clustering, visualization, and feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Idea <a id=\"idea\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Competitive Learning\n",
    "In a Self-Organizing Map, neurons compete to become the best match for input patterns. The winning neuron adjusts its weights to become more similar to the input pattern, promoting organization based on similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topological Organization\n",
    "SOMs maintain topological organization, meaning that neighboring neurons in the map represent similar input patterns. This property allows for smooth transitions between representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neighborhood Function\n",
    "The neighborhood function determines how neighboring neurons are influenced during training. It starts with a wide neighborhood and gradually shrinks, enabling gradual adaptation of neurons.\n",

    "### Weight Update Rule\n",
    "The weight update rule for a neuron \\(i\\) in a Self-Organizing Map is given by:\n",
    "\n",

    "The learning rate \\(\\alpha(t)\\) controls the rate of learning in SOMs. It typically decreases over time during training to ensure convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neighborhood Radius\n",
    "The neighborhood radius \\(h_i(t)\\) defines the extent of influence of neighboring neurons during training. It starts large and gradually decreases.\n",

    "\n",
    " In a nutshell, an SOM comprises neurons in the grid, which gradually adapt to the intrinsic shape of our data. The final result allows us to visualize data points and identify clusters in a lower dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    " So how does the SOM grid learn the shape of our data? Well, this is done in an iterative process, which is summarized in the following steps, and visualized in the animated GIF below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 0: Randomly position the grid’s neurons in the data space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: Select one data point, either randomly or systematically cycling through the dataset in order\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 2: Find the neuron that is closest to the chosen data point. This neuron is called the Best Matching Unit (BMU).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 3: Move the BMU closer to that data point. The distance moved by the BMU is determined by a learning rate, which decreases after each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 4: Move the BMU’s neighbors closer to that data point as well, with farther away neighbors moving less. Neighbors are identified using a radius around the BMU, and the value for this radius decreases after each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 5: Update the learning rate and BMU radius, before repeating Steps 1 to 4. Iterate these steps until positions of neurons have been stabilized.\n",
